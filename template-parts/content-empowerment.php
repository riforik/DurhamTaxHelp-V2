                        <p>
                            Financial empowerment is an approach to poverty reduction that focuses
                            on improving the financial security of low-income people. It does this by introducing
                            a set of interventions that together help low-income Canadians to
                            grow their incomes, improve their credit scores, savings and debt levels, and
                            build wealth through education, employment, entrepreneurship and improved
                            housing.<br />
                            <br />Financial empowerment isn’t like most other poverty reduction approaches.
                            It focuses on helping low-income people participate and feel included in
                            our financial system. It increases their opportunities and knowledge, and
                            fosters behaviours that are critical to their economic security and their ability
                            to invest in their future.

                            Most bank accounts have a service fee, and the Government of Canada has agreements with most major banks to offer low fee accounts. Service fees on these accounts cannot exceed $4.00/month. These accounts must also include:

                            Getting access to neutral information about debt and credit can be difficult. How Credit Counselling Helps A credit counsellor can help with budgeting, basic credit counselling and tips and options for negotiating with creditors. Do some research because some companies offering to help pay off debt are misleading customers. Agencies may be not for profit but this doesn’t mean that all services are free. Look for agencies accredited with these associations:
